- Most of the content right now is in the `_sections` directory, so [click here](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/betterinformatics/tree/master/_sections) to view the list of sections to edit.
- Pull requests are accepted, but we encourage you to create an issue to add your GitHub username to the whitelist. Then you can edit this repository yourself (you don't have to send a PR!)
