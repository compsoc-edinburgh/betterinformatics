  Avoid putting the answer at the start of entry to prevent spoilers (unless it affects the question)

  - May 2018
    - **1(c)**: the correction calculation is indeed `15/56 - 15/64`, but it comes out to `0.03348...`, not the given `0.003`
    - **2(a)**: the answer is correct, but you might find it more natural to do `P(X=0)` with the binomial distribution, which produces the exact same answer (`0.2084...`)
