- Write your Intro, Conclusion and Abstract last — your project might change by the time you've written everything else.
    - Abstract: The advertisement for your paper. You want to start with a very general scope and narrow down to specifics very quickly. Don't use jargon. Do flex your results.
    - Introduction: Similar in that you want to be general, but you have more space. You need to talk about the Motivation, Objective, Contribution and Organisation.
    - Conclusion: An overview of the project and your results. You'll want to have "Critical evaluation of own work" in here and also discuss how the project has helped you (the latter isn't in the marking scheme however was advised to include this).
- Ask your supervisor if you can use "I" and what tense to use. My supervisor banned "I" and mandated past tense, YMMV.
- Find some linter or other tool to check the LaTeX you have written before submission. There are a bunch of small things you can do to make things render nicely: for example, \`\`quote'' instead of "quote", `---` instead of —, etc.
