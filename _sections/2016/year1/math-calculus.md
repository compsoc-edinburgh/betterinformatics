-   If you bought your book second-hand, you will need to buy a
    WebAssign code.
    - First [enroll here](https://www.webassign.net/v4cgi/selfenroll/classkey.html).
    - You can get the class key from [here](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2194925-dt-content-rid-4132148_1/courses/MATH080582016-7SV1SEM2/syllabus-CAP2017.pdf). Make sure you're already logged into Learn before clicking that link.
    - The class key is EVERYTHING on the line with the numbers (the institution code does not contain numbers)
    - More info coming soon on how to actually buy the code...
