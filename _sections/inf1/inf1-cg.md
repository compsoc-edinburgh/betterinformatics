**Priority reading list**

All of the readings are examinable, but if you want to prioritise, here is the recommended order:

* Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 of Pinker's "Words and Rules", minus places where there's no relevance to lecture content
* Chapter 4 of Harley's "Psychology of Language"
* Any academic paper covering something you're not sure you fully understand. For example, if you're not 100% clear on perceptrons, have a look at the Gurney reading
