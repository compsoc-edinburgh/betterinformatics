-   **Tip from a (current) 3rd year**: the maths exams are also open
    book, so I'd recommend taking in past papers with solutions as they
    reuse questions a lot. They might not necessarily be the same, but
    they'll likely be close enough to give you a hand.
-   [No bullshit concept maps](https://minireference.com/static/tutorials/conceptmap.pdf) good for seeing the big picture in the course
-   [Linear algebra explained in 4 pages](https://minireference.com/static/tutorials/linear_algebra_in_4_pages.pdf) good resource to give you general idea. Might be worthwhile to go through it before the start of the course.

-   Answers for Poole ([3rd edition], [4th edition])
-   [42 - calc app capable of Eigenstuff and other linear algebra](http://math-42.com/)
-   **The Exam** - 3 hours - Open Book
    <br>Section A: 40% - 6 questions - conceptual questions, a bit like Tophat
    <br>Section B: 60% - 4 questions (pick 3) - longer, conceptual questions
    <br>You may bring:
    -   the Poole textbook
    -   any non-graphical calculator
    -   any notes (written / printed notes, *nothing bound*)
