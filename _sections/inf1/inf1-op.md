**About the exam**

* The exam is 2 hours. It used to be 3 hours in previous years. They will not pressure you for time, don't worry.
* There is a mock exam in week 11.
* All code must compile for ANY credit at all. If you miss a single semicolon, you get 0 marks. Trip-check if it compiles and is the right file before submitting!
* Your code must also pass the very basic tests (JUnit tests, these will be provided in the exam for you to check) to get any credit at all.

 -   **What's the deal with IntelliJ?**
    - Unfortunately, the exam is optimised for Eclipse. Apparently IntelliJ does dodgy things in the exam, making things scary.
    - It is recommended that you use Eclipse just for this course, and once you're done, move to the blissful IntelliJ.
    - If you insist on using IntelliJ, follow these steps for the first run:
      - Open the command line, and run `idea-ce`. This allows you to start the IDE.
      - On first run, it will ask you to choose some preferences.
      - Eventually, on the last screen or so, it will complain about permission issues, or needing an admin password.
      - At this point, go back to the command line, and press ctrl-c to force the IDE closed.
      - From now on, all future runs of `idea-ce` will work fine without needing to follow these instructions.
    - **Gotchas**: you can't use the "Open project" feature in IntelliJ (because of reasons). To open a project, run the `idea-ce` command with a path to the project file provided to it: `idea-ce path/to/idea/project/file/here`.
