Until 2024, a similar course called "Calculus and its Applications" ran. That course was mandatory for all Informatics students and ran in Sem 2. 

CAFI on the other hand runs in Semester 1 and is only mandatory for those without an advanced maths background in high school. Beware when using checking old exams or other people's notes!

- [Fox's notes](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/bi-cap/releases/latest/download/reference.pdf) ([src](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/bi-cap))
- Cheat sheet PDFs of the [definitions and theorems](https://files.betterinformatics.com/document/exam-cheatsheet-for-definition-and-theorems-2018) to save you time in the exam (no need to search through the textbook)
- [SympyGamma](http://www.sympygamma.com/) - a tool similar to WolframAlpha, but also offering explanation for derivations. 
- [Answers for Essential calculus](http://slader.com/textbook/9781133112280-stewart-essential-calculus-early-transcendentals-2nd-edition/)
- [Riemann sums](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tgyr42ezjq) online calculator
- [Lots of formulae](http://mei.org.uk/files/pdf/formula_book_mf2.pdf)
- [Amazing mindmap](/static/year1/HL_Calculus_Option_Mind_Map.compressed.pdf)

<!--
-   If you bought your book second-hand, you will need to buy a
    WebAssign code.
    - First [enroll here](https://www.webassign.net/v4cgi/selfenroll/classkey.html).
    - You can get the class key from [here](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2194925-dt-content-rid-4176382_1/courses/MATH080582016-7SV1SEM2/syllabus-CAP2017%281%29.pdf). Make sure you're already logged into Learn before clicking that link.
    - The class key is EVERYTHING on the line with the numbers (the institution code does not contain numbers)
    - To buy a WebAssign code, go into Blackwell's and ask the desk at the back (on the education floor) for a WebAssign code.
      - If you try to buy it online through the system, the code will cost $$$ (yes, three digits).
      - In store it costs Â£30.
    - **You can use the WebAssign system for free during the first two weeks before it asks you for the code.**
    - When you try to log in, it will ask for a code or ask you if you want to continue the trial. That's where you enter the code.
