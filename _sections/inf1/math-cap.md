<!--
-   If you bought your book second-hand, you will need to buy a
    WebAssign code.
    - First [enroll here](https://www.webassign.net/v4cgi/selfenroll/classkey.html).
    - You can get the class key from [here](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2194925-dt-content-rid-4176382_1/courses/MATH080582016-7SV1SEM2/syllabus-CAP2017%281%29.pdf). Make sure you're already logged into Learn before clicking that link.
    - The class key is EVERYTHING on the line with the numbers (the institution code does not contain numbers)
    - To buy a WebAssign code, go into Blackwell's and ask the desk at the back (on the education floor) for a WebAssign code.
      - If you try to buy it online through the system, the code will cost $$$ (yes, three digits).
      - In store it costs £30.
    - **You can use the WebAssign system for free during the first two weeks before it asks you for the code.**
    - When you try to log in, it will ask for a code or ask you if you want to continue the trial. That's where you enter the code.
